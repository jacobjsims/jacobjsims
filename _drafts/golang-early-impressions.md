Have you ever watched an old old cartoon or movie from your childhood that you simply loved and it was better than you remembered?

Go has become my Voltron, GI Joe, Fraggle Rock, and Tranformers all in one. 

For some background, the past couple of years I find myself being able to code a little less and less with each day. You know to make time for all those presentations, emails, financial models, and such. That trend does not sit well with me and to compensate I have been furiously trying to find a language that rekindles my love of code. Don't get me wrong I love to code...there has just been something missing when I do it now versus when I got started.

Go has in an odd way been able to capture my imagination where other languages and platforms have not been able too. So why has it been so fun for me?

### Object Orientation vs Functional vs Procedural
The first thing that jumped out to me was the procedural nature of the code. Believe you me I have loved some object Oriented and functional coding; its just that these approaches feel slightly contrived and elitest like a dandy at a royal party. Procedural approaches remind me of Norman Rockwell painting, classic simple with no pretension. Google built the language with an expressed objective to be productive and utilitarian; I love this. It just feels so good to dive in and build something of value. It's like Node before the bloat.

### The Warm C blanket
Another thing that has pulled me in is the fact that Go is a C derived language. I started learning development in C. C based languages have always felt so clean and nostalgic. 

### Syntax & Style
The syntax is simple yet expressive, but it does feel in some places that things have been changed for the sake of change. Some examples.
