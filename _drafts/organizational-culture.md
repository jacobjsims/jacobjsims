Peter Drucker said it best "Culture eats strategy for breakfast."


Creating a culture that empowers, attracts, and retains remarkable creative talent has been a life long quest. The journey and steps always change with each new challenge, but the learning never ceases.  

So what exactly is a great culture and how do you create one?

1. Take continuous learning and discipline

So much can be said on leadership, decision making, hiring, and transparency when you talk about culture. For me the most important trait of a phenomenal culture is a willingness to always learn coupled with the discipline to understand why, what, how, and when to change. So often cultural norms are immortalized into a mission and set of values that exist blindly and starkly separate from the actual culture of an organization.

Helping a culture thrive takes constant investment through active listening and humility. It is equal parts listening to the story as it is writing it. Do your actions align with what is on the wall? Do you and your team actively practice "living" your values or are they mere words? 

When they do not align how to do you behave? Have you and your team reflected on the differences? Having the discipline to consistently and repeatedly follow up ensures that your culture grows.

2. Drive toward alignment & autonomy
Key point - Culture takes a team it. It grows organically not through control. Focus on enabling autonomy through alignment.

My favorite cultural manfesto is the two part Spotify Engineering Culture videos. Early in the first video the narrator describes two measures of an organization. Alignment, meaning the degree to which each team understands the relationship of their activity to the vision and objectives of the organization. Autonomy, in the sense that teams or individuals are empowered to act without the need for rigorous over site of daily decisions.


3. Function like a great relationship
Key Point - Two way street that is communication & humility based (NOT evolution that is in the above)
From my perspective culture is a relationship requiring active listening and participation. Just like a relationship there are always two or more parties. This means that there are two or views, opinions, and sets of beliefs.  

Strong relationships take a combination of active listening, humility, a willingness to change, and most importantly someone willing to take the first step. As a leader your job is to take that first step. When was the last time you had a conversation with an employee asking not "What went right" but "How could we do better?". How will you take the first step to learning and growing for your team?


##Conclusion
Strong cultures are not decreed they are built over time. Cultures evolve through continued repeated dialogue and demonstration of real values. As leaders it is our responsibility to cultivate remarkable cultures that enable our teams and business to thrive. It is exciting and humbling to help an organization find its soul.
